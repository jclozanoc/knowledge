# My Knowledge Wiki

This is my personal work in progress wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an online GitBook hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jclozanoc/knowledge).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](https://github.com/jclozanoc/knowledge/tree/ea5651e2eaf477ea255e9614e62485b419dd15a0/meta/meta.md) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals.

Below will be [notes](https://github.com/jclozanoc/knowledge/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) & their relations visualized.

## Grow your own digital garden ðŸŒ±

Such wikis are also called [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.

## Contributing

If you found a mistake anywhere, I would appreciate your help. GitBook provides a quick way to open GitHub page for any entry so you can make changes and submit a PR.

I'd love to hear any [ideas you have](https://github.com/jclozanoc/knowledge/issues/new) on how I can improve this wiki.
